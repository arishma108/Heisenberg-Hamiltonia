# Heisenberg-Hamiltonia
<br>
Prepare the ground state of a Heisenberg spin-1/2 Hamiltonian on a kagome lattice using IBM Quantum's 16-qubit ibmq_guadalupe system. 
<br>
The ground states of such systems are highly entangled and linked to exotic quantum behavior at the forefront of quantum research. 
<br>
The goal is to compute the ground state energy with the highest fidelity using VQE
